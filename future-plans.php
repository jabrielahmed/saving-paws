              <p>Part   of our mission is to help special needs pets. Our philosophy is that   ALL pets are worth saving, even if they have behavioral or health   problems. Which is why our future plans include building separate   shelter areas for a variety of special needs pets who would otherwise be   euthanized. We intend to construct safe, secure, forever housing for   these pets, including: </p>
              <p>•   Cats who spray or urinate outside the litterbox: this is a common   problem with male cats who are marking their territory. Most of the time   this behavior can be corrected with neuter surgery or changes in the   home environment to correct the stimulus, but sometimes the kitty will   continue to spray.</p>
              <p>•   Feline-leukemia positive cats and kittens: feline leukemia is the   number one viral infectious disease killer of cats. Feline leukemia can   take one of two forms; it either attacks the immune system, predisposing   cats to a wide variety of infectious diseases, or, the cat will develop   cancer in the form of tumors or leukemia. But feline-leukemia positive   cats do not need to be euthanized immediately; many can live out an   entire lifetime. We feel they should be able to live out their lives in   comfort and safety, until they exhibit signs of the illness to the point   that they are no longer healthy enough to enjoy life. We hope to raise   funds to build a special room for these kitties.</p>
              <p>•   FIV-positive cats and kittens: FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus)   attacks a cat&rsquo;s immune system, impairing ability to fight infections. It   is very rare; only 1-3% of cats in the U.S. are infected. As with   feline leukemia cats, FIV-infected cats do not need to be euthanized   immediately; many can live out an entire lifetime as carriers of this   disease without exhibiting any symptoms, and are wonderful, adoptable   indoor companions. We also hope to raise funds to build a special room   for these kitties.</p>
              <p>•   Dog housing: We currently do not have proper room to care for dogs on   our property, and we need a quarantine area and training facility for   the SPARKED program. With a facility we can help families and dogs with   emergency boarding in the event of a hospitailization or disaster. We   hope to build kennels and indoor/outdoor housing areas for dogs.</p><br />
