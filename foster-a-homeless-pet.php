			  	<p>&ldquo;When   the shelters are all full, and there is nowhere for me to go…you took   me in, you gave me food, water and shelter…you saved my life.&rdquo; –a foster   pet</p>
                <p> Foster   care is a rewarding experience. Saving Paws relies strongly on our   foster care network to save the lives of hundreds of homeless pets!   Please consider fostering a homeless pet in need!</p>
                <p>One   of the biggest ways you can save a life is by fostering. Fostering   gives dogs and cats the socializing, training, care and love that they   need to prepare them for their new home. Taking a stray or frightened   animal and showing him or her that people can be kind, that food is   available, and that there is a warm place to sleep, creates a marvelous   bridge to a new home.</p>
                <p>We   know many people worry about getting attached to the animal, which is   normal. The most common question asked is how we can give them up. The   answer is simple … it truly saves lives, a lot of them. It is hard to   say goodbye to a pet we&rsquo;ve fallen in love with, but the alternative is   even sadder (3.5 million pets are euthanized every year, most who don&rsquo;t   need to be). Heck, you might even find your next pet this way!</p>
                <p>Please consider being a foster, it&rsquo;s one of the biggest contributions you can make!</p>
                <p>As a foster you can help animals like Luella and Miss Daisy go from horrible conditions to a beloved family member</p>

                <p>As   a foster care provider, you provide food, water, training, grooming,   transportation to vet care, and a lot of TLC. Basic knowledge of animal   care and training is a plus. Foster care providers play an important   role in the adoption process. The foster parent is asked to help provide   the final decision if the adopter is the best fit for that pet. You&rsquo;ve   developed a relationship with the foster pet, and Saving Paws values   your input. If you&rsquo;re not comfortable with the adopter/ family, you can   deny their application for any reason. Our application does state that   we are able to refuse any application.</p>
                <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                <p>If you are interested in fostering a homeless pet for Saving Paws, we need you! <br>
                To foster a dog or puppy, please email dogs@savingpaws.com.<br>
                To foster a cat or kitten, please email cats@savingpaws.com. <br>
                You will need to fill out a Foster Care Application.<br>
                Thank you for your interest in saving the lives of homeless pets!</p>
                <h3>Foster Care Program Guidelines</h3>
                <p>In   order to achieve a successful foster care program, we have established   the following guidelines, since fostering is a team effort and everyone   must understand the expectations.
                The   foster homes will be provided with the food and supplies for the foster   pet, since we prefer to feed Purina or Iams foods, which may help   reduce the chance of gastrointestinal distress and maintaining the   health and weight of animals with special needs.
                As   a foster parent for Saving Paws you have a commitment to the foster   animal.  We ask you to  monitor the foster animal&rsquo;s behavior,   intake/output, condition of fur/ ears/ nails, etc. and notify us with   any concerns or questions.</p>
                <p>The foster coordinators will be available to foster parents and foster parents<br>
                  should contact them directly with any concerns.</p>
                <p>**A   foster animal profile sheet is provided with each foster placement. The   foster parent is required to return the sheet when the foster is   brought back to Saving Paws. This profile assists Saving Paws in   preparing the animal for adoption and provides the prospective adopter   with important information that our foster home has gathered about the   animal, as well as maintaining proper records for our facility.</p>
                <p>Foster   animals should be under the direct supervision of the foster parent at   all times. If a foster parent must travel away from home, contact Saving   Paws foster care coordinator for instructions.</p>
                <p>Foster   animals are never to be treated by the foster parents&rsquo; own   veterinarian. The foster parent should contact the Saving Paws foster   home coordinator if veterinary services are needed.</p>
                <h3>Adopting a foster pet</h3>
                <p>Fostering   for Saving Paws Animal Rescue is not a trial adoption. As long as you   are fostering, you&rsquo;ll be helping find permanent homes for the foster   animals in your care. However, foster care providers do sometimes decide   to adopt a pet they&rsquo;re fostering.  If you decide that you&rsquo;d like to   like to adopt a foster pet, we may choose to waive the application   process. But you will be required to complete an adoption contract and   pay the adoption fee in full at the time the contract is signed. You   will then be responsible for providing all necessary care for that   animal as part of your family for the rest of the pet&rsquo;s life.</p>
