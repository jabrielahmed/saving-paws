            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <div class="text">
              <p>Mission   statement  -Saving Paws Animal Rescue Inc. is dedicated to rescuing   homeless, abandoned and special needs animals and finding new adoptive   homes or providing a lifelong sanctuary for them; to train and provide   service dogs to children, adults and Veterans with disabilities to help   with both physical and emotional independence. We also seek to educate   the public regarding animal responsibility and the use of service dogs   in public places.</p>
              <h3>History</h3>
              <p>Saving   Paws Animal Rescue Inc. was formed on June 15, 2006 by Michelle McRae   and Betsy Moder along with a small group of animal lovers in Appleton,   Wisconsin.</p>
              <p>Michelle   and Betsy had been rescuing and caring for homeless, abandoned, sick,   injured and special needs   pets for more than 13 years on their own.    They met at a veterinarian&rsquo;s office, joined forces and the rest is   history.</p>
              <p>We received our official 501(c)(3) letter in September, 2006.</p>
              <p>We typically have 50 to 75 cats and kittens at our shelter at any given time.  Our dogs are kept in foster homes.</p>
              <p>The   pets we help come from many areas. We Help many kitties who are rescued from farms or found abandoned. We also help people who need to surrender their pets because they can no longer care for them. We try to help as many people and pets as we can, but we often have waiting list.</p><br>

				<h3>NAOMI'S Story</h3>
				<p>We saved this beautiful girl from a high kill shelter who took awhile to make her way to us due to some concerning health issues. During this short time she lost so much… the use of her back legs, much weight, muscle, and endurance. But what she didn’t lose was her spirit. She’s come a long way from being paralyzed, to being a happy pup who can now walk and run. If it wasn’t for rescue, she wouldn’t be alive today. She’s an inspiration to all of us and will make a family very happy.  Naomi has been adopted and is living happily in her furever home.</p><br>
