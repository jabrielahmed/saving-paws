            <h2>Our Special Needs Pets</h2>
			  <p>At Saving Paws, we believe ALL pets are worth saving. Part of our mission is to help special needs pets find new forever homes – whether it be with new adoptive families, or with us. The following special needs pets each have a unique story.  Please consider adopting or fostering a special needs pet!</p>
			  <p>FIV cats can live healthy, long, and happy lives with a  little TLC, yearly vet exams and vaccinations, and a good diet (things all cats should get anyway!).  FIV is not contagious to people or dogs – only other cats.</p>

				  <h5>Princess - ADOPTED 9-16</h5>
				  <p>Princess certainly lives up to her name.  She reigns over the room with her subjects.  Princess is FIV positive.  This means that she would need to never be let outdoors, and should be an only cat, or live with another FIV positive cat.  If you are interested in meeting her, please contact us at info@savingpaws.com.</p>

				  <h5>Blackie - ADOPTED 9-16</h5>
				  <p>Blackie - DOB 3-11-06 is a gentle and friendly sweetheart looking for a place to call home, and like any other cat, is just looking to share his love with his new person or family. Blackie is FIV positive, but otherwise healthy, and ready to go home. Having FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus), means his immune system is not as strong as that of a non-FIV cat. FIV cats can live healthy, long, and happy lives with a little TLC, yearly vet exams and vaccinations, and a good diet (things all cats should get anyway!). Blackie needs to be kept inside to protect his immune system. FIV is not contagious to people or dogs – only other cats.</p>

				<p>We often have FIV positive cats in our care. Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is a rare disease that affects under 3% of the US cat population. It is essentially “kitty AIDS” and affects the cat’s immune system. However, cats with FIV can live for years as carriers of this disease and never be affected by it – especially if they are indoor-only cast who are not exposed to the dangers and elements of the outdoors. We believe all pets are worth saving, even if they have diseases like FIV, which is why we believe all pets deserve a loving new home. FIV is only spread to other cats through bite wounds, so it would be rare he could pass it to another house cat. For more information on FIV in cats, please visit the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine.</p>
