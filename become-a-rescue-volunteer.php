			  <h2>Join the Saving Paws Volunteer Family</h2>
		    <div>
			    <p>We   rely entirely on volunteers to care for the homeless, abandoned,   injured and special needs pets we shelter. We are in constant need of   volunteers to help in a variety of areas - please see below for the   types of opportunities available as well as other important information   regarding volunteer requirements.</p>
			    <p>Become a Saving Paws volunteer in three steps:</p>
			    <p>1. <a href="https://www.volunteermatters.net/vm/SelfRegister.do?owner=spar" target="_blank" data-content="https://www.volunteermatters.net/vm/SelfRegister.do?owner=spar" data-type="external">Submit an application here!</a></p>

			    <p>3. Attend the orientation, receive training, and start helping!</p>
			    <p> </p>
			    <p>To become a volunteer, you&rsquo;ll need to attend a Volunteer Orientation after <a href="https://www.volunteermatters.net/vm/SelfRegister.do?owner=spar" target="_blank" data-content="https://www.volunteermatters.net/vm/SelfRegister.do?owner=spar" data-type="external">submitting an application</a>.   At orientation you&rsquo;ll learn more about how the rescue operates and how   you can help. You&rsquo;ll get a tour of the rescue and learn specific   functions about your area of interest.  There   is additional training required for several volunteer duties, and those   training sessions will be discussed during orientation. Please contact the Volunteer Coodinators at <a href="mailto:volunteers@savingpaws.com?subject=Volunteer%20Orientation" target="_self" data-content="volunteers@savingpaws.com" data-type="mail">volunteers@savingpaws.com</a> to arrange a date and time for orientation.</p>
