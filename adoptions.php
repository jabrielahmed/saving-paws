            <h2>Adopting a Pet from Saving Paws Animal Rescue</h2>
            <p>Thank   you for considering saving the life of a homeless pet. Adopting your   next furry family member is a very rewarding experience and they are   very special companions.</p>
            <p>When   you adopt one of our pets, you save more lives. By taking home a   rescued pet and making it part of your family, you open up a space for   another pet to be saved. Your adoption is a gift that keeps on giving.</p>
            <p>We   have a wide variety of pets waiting to find their new people —   different sizes and colors, breeds and breed mixes, and different   personalities.</p>
            <h3>How to meet our adoptable pets </h3>
            <p>We   currently do not have regular business hours.  By making an appointment   you&rsquo;ll be able to meet the pet you are interested in. Please understand   that not all of our available pets live at the rescue; some are in   private foster homes.   For more information about meeting or adopting   pets, contact us at: </p>

            <h3>To adopt from Saving Paws, just follow these simple steps: </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Fill out an adoption application online under  the adoptions tab at www.savingpaws.com.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>(Processing   your application can take anywhere from 1-4 days depending on response   time by references.  Once you are approved, you may return to pick up   your new companion(s). All applications are evaluated on a case-by-case   basis. If your application is not filled out in full it will not be   processed.) </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>Set an appointment to meet an adoptable pet. We are fully volunteer run and don&rsquo;t have regular hours, so we will set up a time that works for you   to come visit. We are located in north Appleton and when you set up an   appointment we will give you directions to our rescue.</p>
